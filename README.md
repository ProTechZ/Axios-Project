# Axios Project
---

This project was a way for me to play around with the Axios.js library and use its HTTP request methods.

The request methods I have used are the GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE methods. I have also done simultaneous GET requests to demonstrate how to make more than one request at the same time.
